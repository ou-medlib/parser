## Description
The OUWBMedlib\Parser package will parse a CSV file 
of records for display as one or more record lists 
on one or more webpages.

It was designed to parse a spreadsheet of textbook records
into a textbook list for each course in a four-year curriculum
for which the textbooks are either recommended or required.

Changes to the spreadsheet are reflected across
all textbook lists on all pages.

There is also a debug mode which can be used to display
a list of all records as well as a validation report, in
order to easily check the data for errors.
