## Installation
It is recommended that you install the latest version of the OUWBMedlib\Parser 
package and its dependencies using composer.  If you are installing
from an existing composer package, you may use the following command
to install the necessary files:

```
$ composer require ouwbmedlib\parser
```

If not, you may place the following in a `composer.json` file 
in the directory from which you wish to reference the package:

```
{
    "require": {
        "ouwbmedlib/parser": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

You should then be able to run the command above
and all required packages will be installed.

See the [composer website](https://getcomposer.org) for instructions
on installing composer.
