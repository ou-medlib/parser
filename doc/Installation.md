## Installation

It is recommended that you install the latest version of the OUWBMedlib\Parser 
package and its dependencies using composer.  This will install this package
as well as all other required packages under the `vendor` directory.

If you are installing
from an existing composer package, you may use the following command
to install the necessary files:

```
$ composer require ouwbmedlib/parser
```

If you are not working from an existing composer package, 
you may place the following in a `composer.json` file 
in the directory from which you wish to reference the package:

```
{
    "require": {
        "ouwbmedlib/parser": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

You should then be able to run the following command to install
this and all other required packages.

```
$ composer install
```

See the [composer website](https://getcomposer.org) for instructions
on installing composer.
